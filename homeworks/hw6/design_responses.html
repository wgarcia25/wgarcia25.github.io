							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> <strong> Answer: </strong> In this artcle, the author intends to explain how and when to use interface animations. Having collected a list of all the main principles, the author goes over principles regarding duration, speed, easing, and so much more.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> <strong> Answer: </strong> Overall, I found that my favorite part of the article centered around the principle of easing. To start off, easing is one of the most essential principles of animation and has been recognized as so by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas. Easing should allow the object to imitate the movement of real life objects in order to avoid any artificial feelings. Additionally, there are so many types of easing functions that a designer could use.   </p>
