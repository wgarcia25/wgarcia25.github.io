        <p> Hello! </p>
        <p> My name is Will Garcia. I am an optimistic undergraduate currently majoring in Applied Math at University of California, Berkeley. Additionally, my concentration revolves around Data Science/Analysis. Aside from school, I like to listen to music, hang out with friends and family, and play video games. </p>

        <h3> <strong> Homework Anwers: </strong> </h3>

        <ul>
            <li> <strong> Question 1: </strong> The main idea of the article is to study apps to help you obtain a designers mindset. Question why the designer did this and that. By doing so, you can improve upon the little details that make a big difference.</li>
            <li> <strong> Question 2: </strong> My favorite part about this article is the discussion about breaking down an app. I think it is true that breaking down things bit by bit will show you details you may have missed before. </li>
            <li> <strong> Question 3: </strong> "As you watch each component build upon the next, be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made for this product" - Kathleen Warner </li>
            <li> <strong> Question 4: </strong> The article itself introduced me to some new ways of thinking. Although it wasn't something too shocking, it was beneficial to better understanding how to design. I would give the article a 6/10. </li>
        </ul>
