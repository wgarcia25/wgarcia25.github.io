                            <p> <strong> Answer: </strong> I would say my favorite showcasing was the "Add to Cart" interaction created by Danniel for Norde. I enjoyed the feautures a user would encounter when sliding on the side button of the website. It allows users to  aesthetically customize the size and color of the shoe they desired in real time.  Additionally, the colors and type were well suited. </p>
