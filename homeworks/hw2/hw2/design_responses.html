						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> <strong> Answer: </strong> I believe the main takeaway is that padding can be impactful in a positive way. It acts as a sort of "breath of fresh air" for elements of a design. However, too much air or too little air can be bad. Finding just the right amount is what takes some skill.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> <strong> Answer: </strong> I thought it was cool that they implemented in a rule relating to the Gestalt Principles we learned in the recent lecture. Speficially, the author discusses using a spacing rule where the spacing between every design element should be a multiple of eight pixels. I believe it would relate to multiple Gestalt Principles.  </p>

							<p> <strong> Answer: </strong> "Everyone has heard the saying "less is more". This applies to content on any given page, where less visual noise makes for a better user experience" - Patrick Condon  </p>
